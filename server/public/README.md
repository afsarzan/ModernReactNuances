# Public Folder

This folder contains static files that are served by the Express server.

Any files placed in this directory will be accessible via HTTP at the root path of the server.

Example:
- A file at `public/image.png` will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001/image.png`
- A file at `public/docs/guide.pdf` will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001/docs/guide.pdf`

## Usage

Simply place your static assets (images, PDFs, HTML files, etc.) in this directory and they will be automatically served by the server.
